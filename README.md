Real-time Chat Application
​This is a real-time, browser-based chat application built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows users to connect to a chat room, where they are assigned a unique, random username and can send and receive messages instantly.
​Features
​Real-time Messaging: Messages are sent and received in real-time using WebSockets.
​Unique Usernames: Each user is automatically assigned a unique, randomly generated username upon connecting.
​Simple UI: The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user experience.
​Technologies Used
​Frontend:
​HTML
​JavaScript (ES6+)
​Tailwind CSS
​Socket.IO (client-side library)
​Backend:
​Node.js
​Express.js
​Socket.IO (server-side library)
​unique-names-generator (Node.js package)
​File Structure
​The project is divided into frontend and backend components:
​index.html: The main page for the chat application, containing the message display and input form.
​script.js: The client-side JavaScript that connects to the server, sends messages, and renders the chat history on the page.
​server-completed.js: The backend server logic. This file handles new connections, manages the chat history, and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.
​server-starter.js: An incomplete version of the server file, provided as a reference or a starting point for a learning exercise.
​How to Run the Application
​Follow these steps to get the chat application up and running on your local machine.
1. Save the Files: Ensure you have all  four files (index.html, script.js, server-completed.js, and server-starter.js) in the same directory.
2. Initialize Node.js Project: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and initialize a new Node.js project.
        -->npm init -y
3. Install Dependencies: Install the required packages for the server.
   -->npm install express socket.io unique-names-generator
4. Start the Server: Run the server using Node.js.
    -->node server-completed.js
5. Access the Application: The server will now be running. Open your web browser and go to the following URL:
   -->http://localhost:3000

You can open multiple tabs or browsers to test the real-time chat functionality between different users.
​Deployment
​This is a full-stack application that requires a server to run the backend. It can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, Vercel (using serverless functions), or a traditional cloud provider that supports Node.js applications.
